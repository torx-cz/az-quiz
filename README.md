# az-quiz
Implementation of famous czech "AZ-kvíz" tv game.

### It can do:
- color hexagons for active team & switch teams (use: mouse LEFT button)
- add wrong-answered hexagons (black) (use: mouse RIGHT button)
- reset whole game
- undo moves
- switch team if needed (use: button for current active team "Hraje: Tým X")


### What is missing:
- [ ] end the game (by win or stalemate)
  - win - is when one player connects all sides of the triangle with their colour
  - stalemate - there is no possible way to connect sides of the triangle
